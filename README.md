# MetaNews

### Description

MetaNews is a web app designed to fetch and deliver news articles from major sources around the web. Users can vote on the quality of the article (authenticity, writing), as well as the perceieved bias (left, right). The app tracts the data recieved from users not only to display a per-article summary of the quality and bias, but to record the historical average of news sources and journalists. The goal is to create a news app where users can decide on the integrity of news based on what they read, while also considering the historical record of the publisher and journalist.
